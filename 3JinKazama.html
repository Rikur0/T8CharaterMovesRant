          <p>Jin is the main Character in Tekken 8. His company was called G Corporation. The componay is used to stop the Mishima Zaibatsu from taking over the world. At the end of Tekken 8 he had defeated Kazuya. </p>
          <br>
          <p>He is a all rounder character but most of his kit is torwards a rushdown. He has powerful punishment, space control with long-ranged keep-out attacks, and excellent close-ranged pressure thanks to his pokes and wavedash mix-ups. His execution requirements are strict in high-level play, but he can be played effectively by beginners and masters alike.</p>
